                                target="_blank"> Character Level Language Modeling Using GPT</a>:
                        </strong> This Code Post focuses on implementing a character-level language model using the
                        Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architecture. The objective is to generate coherent
                        text by predicting the next character in a sequence based on previous characters, leveraging the
                        powerful capabilities of GPT.
